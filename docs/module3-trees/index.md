# Module 3: Tree-Based Algorithms

## Overview

Tree-based algorithms are among the most powerful and widely-used techniques in machine learning. From simple decision trees to sophisticated ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost, these algorithms excel at both classification and regression tasks while maintaining interpretability.

## Why Tree-Based Algorithms Matter

Industry relies heavily on tree-based methods:
- **Kaggle competitions**: XGBoost and Random Forest dominate leaderboards
- **Production systems**: Fast inference and easy deployment
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance and tree visualization
- **Versatility**: Handle non-linear relationships, mixed data types
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to outliers than linear models
