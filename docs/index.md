## What You'll Learn

This course is organized into four progressive modules, each building on the previous one:

### :material-calculator: Module 1: Linear Algebra Basics
**Foundation for Understanding ML**

Linear algebra is the mathematical foundation of machine learning. In this module, you'll learn:

- Vector operations and their geometric interpretations
- Matrix operations and transformations
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix decompositions
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and dimensionality reduction

**Time Commitment:** 4-6 hours

[Start Module 1](module1-linear-algebra/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

### :material-chart-line: Module 2: Regression Algorithms
**Predicting Continuous Values**

Build your first machine learning models with regression techniques:

- Linear regression from scratch and with scikit-learn
- Gradient descent and optimization strategies
- Logistic regression for classification problems
- Regularization techniques (L1, L2, Elastic Net)

**Time Commitment:** 6-8 hours

## Course Philosophy

### Learn by Doing
Theory is important, but implementation cements understanding. You'll write code for nearly every concept you learn.

### Build from Scratch
Before using libraries, you'll implement algorithms from scratch using NumPy. This builds deep understanding of how things work under the hood.

### Use Modern Tools
After understanding the fundamentals, you'll use industry-standard libraries like scikit-learn and PyTorch.

### Progressive Complexity
Start with heavy guidance and clear instructions. As you progress, exercises become more open-ended, preparing you for real-world problems.
