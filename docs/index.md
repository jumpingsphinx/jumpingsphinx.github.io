# Welcome to ML101

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

ML101 is a comprehensive, hands-on course designed to teach you machine learning from the ground up. Whether you're a beginner or looking to solidify your understanding of ML fundamentals, this course provides a structured path through essential concepts, algorithms, and implementations.

## What You'll Learn

This course is organized into four progressive modules, each building on the previous one:

### :material-calculator: Module 1: Linear Algebra Basics
**Foundation for Understanding ML**

Linear algebra is the mathematical foundation of machine learning. In this module, you'll learn:

- Vector operations and their geometric interpretations
- Matrix operations and transformations
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix decompositions
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and dimensionality reduction

**Time Commitment:** 4-6 hours

### :material-chart-line: Module 2: Regression Algorithms
**Predicting Continuous Values**

Build your first machine learning models with regression techniques:

- Linear regression from scratch and with scikit-learn
- Gradient descent and optimization strategies
- Logistic regression for classification problems
- Regularization techniques (L1, L2, Elastic Net)

**Time Commitment:** 6-8 hours

## How This Course Works

### :material-book-open-variant: Read the Lessons
Each module contains detailed lesson pages with theory, mathematical explanations, visualizations, and code examples. Take your time to understand the concepts before moving to exercises.

### :material-code-braces: Complete the Exercises
Every module includes hands-on Jupyter notebook exercises. These interactive notebooks let you implement what you've learned and see immediate results.

### :material-check-circle: Review Solutions
After attempting the exercises, review the solution notebooks. These include not just the code, but explanations of the approach and alternative solutions.

### :material-flask: Experiment and Explore
Modify parameters, try different datasets, and experiment with variations to deepen your understanding.

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- **Python programming:** Comfortable with Python syntax, functions, and basic data structures
- **Basic mathematics:** High school algebra and basic calculus concepts

### Technical Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- 4GB RAM minimum
- Code editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Lab)

## Course Philosophy

### Learn by Doing
Theory is important, but implementation cements understanding. You'll write code for nearly every concept you learn.

### Build from Scratch
Before using libraries, you'll implement algorithms from scratch using NumPy. This builds deep understanding of how things work under the hood.

### Use Modern Tools
After understanding the fundamentals, you'll use industry-standard libraries like scikit-learn and PyTorch.

### Progressive Complexity
Start with heavy guidance and clear instructions. As you progress, exercises become more open-ended, preparing you for real-world problems.
